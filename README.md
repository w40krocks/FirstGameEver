this is the first game I have ever made on godot,
its supposed to be a rough emulation of the orignal doom games,
this is not going to be a fully playable game ever,
but i might use a similiar format for future proejcts,
this is just an excuse to learn the engine and game development in general, i doubt this will be of use to anyone
